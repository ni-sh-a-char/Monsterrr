## 🚀 Autonomous AI for GitHub Organization Management

## 🚀 Render Deployment Instructions

Monsterrr is production-ready for Render. To deploy:

1. **Connect your GitHub repo to Render.**
2. **Add environment variables** from `.env` to Render's dashboard (never commit secrets).
3. **Ensure your repo contains:**
   - `Procfile` (web and worker entries)
   - `render.yaml` (web and worker services)
   - `requirements.txt`
   - All source code in the repo root.
4. **Render will auto-detect and run:**
   - FastAPI API (`web`): `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
   - Discord bot (`worker`): `python -m services.discord_bot_runner`

**No manual intervention required.**

For local development, use:
```powershell
set PYTHONPATH=C:\Projects\Monsterrr
python -m honcho start
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment (All-in-One Mode)

Monsterrr can also be deployed using Docker with a single container that runs all services:

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t monsterrr .
   ```

2. **Run with all services in one container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 -e START_MODE=all monsterrr
   ```

This mode runs all worker processes in the background and displays only the web server output in the terminal.

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Server starts and binds to port 8000
- ✅ Health check endpoint returns 200 OK with status information
- ✅ Worker processes run in background without cluttering terminal output
- ✅ Web server output is clearly displayed with startup information
- ✅ Memory usage is properly reported (81.06 MB in tests)

Example health check response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-27T17:47:05.418395",
  "memory_usage_mb": 81.06,
  "port": "8000"
}
```

---

## 🔄 Startup Modes

Monsterrr supports multiple startup modes to suit different deployment needs:

| Mode | Description | Usage |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `web` | Web server only | `START_MODE=web python start_monsterrr.py` |
| `worker` | Worker processes only | `START_MODE=worker python start_monsterrr.py` |
| `hybrid` | Both web and worker in single process | `START_MODE=hybrid python start_monsterrr.py` |
| `all` | All services with workers in background | `START_MODE=all python start_monsterrr.py` |

The `all` mode is recommended for Docker deployments as it provides the cleanest terminal output while running all services.

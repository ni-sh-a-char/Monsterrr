# Monsterrr

Autonomous AI system for GitHub organization management.

## Overview
Monsterrr is a multi-agent, always-on system that discovers, creates, and maintains open-source projects for the `ni_sh_a.char` GitHub organization. It leverages the Groq LLM API for all reasoning and code generation, and automates repository management, issue triage, and project scaffolding.

## Features
- **Idea Generator Agent:** Fetches trending project ideas, summarizes and ranks them with Groq, and stores results. Loads and validates all required `.env` variables before any operation.
- **Creator Agent:** Creates new repos, scaffolds code, commits boilerplate, and opens starter issues. Loads and validates all required `.env` variables before any operation. Fails fast if credentials are missing or invalid.
- **Maintainer Agent:** Monitors repos, responds to issues, auto-closes stale tickets, and suggests fixes with Groq. Loads and validates all required `.env` variables before any operation. Fails fast if credentials are missing or invalid.
- **Scheduler:** Runs daily/weekly jobs and sends a weekly status report email.
- **FastAPI API:** Webhooks, manual triggers, and status endpoints.
- **Production-ready:** Robust error handling, retries, logging, and CI/CD. All agents use structured logging and retry logic for Groq and GitHub API calls.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
	```sh
	git clone <your-org>/Monsterrr.git
	cd Monsterrr
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your secrets:
	```sh
	cp .env.example .env
	# Edit .env with your keys and SMTP credentials
	# All agents require GROQ_API_KEY, GROQ_MODEL, GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_ORG, SMTP_HOST, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, STATUS_REPORT_RECIPIENTS, DRY_RUN, and MAX_AUTO_CREATIONS_PER_DAY to be set.
	# Agents will fail fast and log errors if any required variable is missing or invalid.
	```

## Running Locally


Start the API locally:
```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Start the scheduler:
```sh
python monsterrr/scheduler.py
```

Run agents manually for diagnostics:
```sh
python agents/idea_agent.py
python agents/creator_agent.py
python agents/maintainer_agent.py
```
All agents will log credential validation and fail fast if `.env` is missing required values.

### SMTP Troubleshooting


If emails are not being sent:
- Double-check your `.env` for correct `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, and `SMTP_PASS` (Gmail requires an App Password, not your main password).
- On startup, Monsterrr logs a "SMTP connectivity check" result. If it fails, check the error log for details.
- If using Gmail, ensure "2-Step Verification" is enabled and you generated an App Password for "Mail".
- Some providers (Zoho, Outlook, etc.) may require different ports or security settings.
- If you see a traceback in the logs, use it to diagnose the problem or ask for help.

### Credential Validation & Error Handling
All agents load and validate `.env` before any operation. If any required credential or config is missing or invalid, agents will log a clear error and exit immediately. GitHub and Groq API calls use robust error handling and retry logic. See logs for details on failures and diagnostics.

## Running in Docker
Build and run (dev):
```sh
docker build -t monsterrr:dev --target dev .
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 monsterrr:dev
```



## Deployment to Render
1. Push code to your GitHub org.
2. Connect Render to the repo.
3. Add all required .env variables in the Render dashboard (see `.env.example` for reference).
4. Render will run the API service using:
	```sh
	uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
	```
	and install dependencies with:
	```sh
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
5. The scheduler and agents will run automatically in the background.
6. All environment variables are loaded at startup using `python-dotenv`.
7. For production, reload is disabled and all credentials are validated at startup.

**Render Start Command:**
```
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## .env Variables
```
# ==== Groq API ====
GROQ_API_KEY=sk-your-groq-key-here
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile      # Best tradeoff between cost, quality, and speed
GROQ_TEMPERATURE=0.2         # Low temp for factual, consistent outputs
GROQ_MAX_TOKENS=2048         # Long enough for detailed reports

# ==== GitHub ====
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp-your-pat-here
GITHUB_ORG=ni-sh-a-char      # Matches your org slug exactly

# ==== Email (SMTP) ====
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com     # Gmail example, can be Outlook, Zoho, etc.
SMTP_PORT=587                # TLS port
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password  # Special app password (see below)

# ==== Status Reports ====
STATUS_REPORT_RECIPIENTS=you@example.com,teammate@example.com

## UptimeRobot Setup (Recommended for Render Free Tier)
To keep Monsterrr awake and running on Render's free tier, set up UptimeRobot to ping your `/health` endpoint every 5â€“10 minutes:

1. Go to [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) and create a free account.
2. Click "Add New Monitor" > Type: HTTP(s).
3. Set the URL to `https://your-monsterrr-url.onrender.com/health`.
4. Set monitoring interval to 5 minutes.
5. Save and enable the monitor.

This will keep your Render service active and Monsterrr running 24/7.

## Testing
Run all tests:
```sh
pytest --cov=monsterrr
```
Lint and format:
```sh
flake8 monsterrr && black monsterrr
```
